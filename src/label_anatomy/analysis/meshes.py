"""Geometry for the 3D widgets and the Blender export: meshes, outlines, skeletons.

Geometry never enters the report table, because it would multiply the size of the report
every stats query loads. It goes beside it instead, one ``geometry.parquet`` per object, with
the payloads as BLOBs compressed by parquet's own zstd.

Parquet rather than a blob file makes it queryable: DuckDB filters by object, entity and
metric and returns only the rows about to be drawn, so opening one structure costs its own
few MB rather than the whole object's.
