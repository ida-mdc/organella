"""A process pool for the per-instance work inside one object.

Meshing and contact gaps have the same shape: thousands of independent pieces of work, each
on a small crop of one object. Neither is covered by the batch running objects in parallel,
because that pool is sized by what an object costs in memory rather than by cores - on a
batch of large objects it is a handful of workers on a machine with many more cores than
that, and the rest sit idle while one instance at a time is measured.

Both also share the same two hazards, which is why this is one class and not two:

- **spawn, not fork.** The process holds native threads (ITK, BLAS, polars) and a forked
  child can deadlock on their locks. The batch pool specifies spawn for the same reason, and
  Python 3.12 warns when it is not.
- **a pool is not always worth opening.** Spawn costs about a second to stand up workers,
  and every task pays pickling on the way out and back. Whether that is repaid depends on
  the total work, which the number of instances does not predict, so WorkPool measures one
  batch before deciding rather than guessing from a count.
