"""Branches, length and tortuosity, read off a curve skeleton's graph.

These are the three metrics a filament is judged by — they drive their own violins, and
the gallery sorts by them — and all three come from the shape of the skeleton graph rather
than from the voxels. So the graph is what the tests hand over: a stand-in skeleton with
the vertices and edges of a known topology, which pins the counting rules exactly
(a straight strand is one branch, a Y is three, a closed loop is one) without depending on
what kimimaro happens to skeletonise a small synthetic volume into.

The tortuosity cases are geometric for the same reason: a straight branch is 1 by
definition, and a quarter circle is π/2 ÷ √2 whatever produced it.
