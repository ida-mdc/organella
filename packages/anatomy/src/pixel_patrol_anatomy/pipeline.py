"""Run the processors over a batch of object folders and write one report.

PixelPatrol's own pipeline splits a record that exceeds a memory budget. An object cannot
survive that: its measurements are cross-entity, so a chunk holding two of five entities
can answer almost nothing. This runs the processors directly, one whole object at a time in a
pool sized by what an object actually costs, and writes the parquet the viewer reads.

Row layout, unchanged from what the widgets expect:
  obs_level = 0   one row per object, with the instance/distance/contact list columns
