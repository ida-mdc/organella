"""Loader that turns one object folder into one PixelPatrol record.

The unit of analysis is a *folder*: a source image plus its entity volumes
(``<prefix>_<name>_label.tif`` / ``_mask.tif``). ``is_folder_supported`` claims such
a folder, so PixelPatrol hands the directory itself to ``read_header`` / ``load``
and never descends into it, so the TIFFs inside are not records of their own.

``load`` stacks every entity along a C axis, ``CZYX`` for a volume and ``CYX`` for a plane,
with ``channel_names`` naming them. That shape gives:

* one row per object at ``obs_level=0``, one row per entity at ``obs_level=1`` (``dim_c``);
  process with ``--slice-size C=1 --slice-size Z=-1`` so a leaf block is one entity volume;
* every entity of an object in one record, so cross-entity metrics (distances, contacts)
  can be computed by a single processor.
