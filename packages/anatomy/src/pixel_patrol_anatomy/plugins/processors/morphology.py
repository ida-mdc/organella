"""Per-entity morphology processor.

One leaf block is one entity volume of one object (process with
``--slice-size C=1 --slice-size Z=-1``), so this processor emits one row per entity per
object at ``obs_level=1``, keyed by ``dim_c`` → ``channel_names``. Those rows are what
makes ``entity_name`` a groupable column in the viewer, with scalar metrics PixelPatrol's
own widgets can plot.

A leaf sees only its own entity, which bounds what belongs here: whole-structure
morphology for masks, and counts and totals for labels. Everything that needs the rest
of the object - per-instance measurements, distances, contacts - is measured by the
object-level (MEMORY) processors instead.
