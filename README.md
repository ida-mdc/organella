# Anatomy: spatial analysis of segmented objects

Anatomy analyses TIFF segmentations (labels + masks), 2D or 3D, for one object or many, and
produces a single [PixelPatrol](https://pixelpatrol.app/) report you explore in an
interactive viewer: distributions, distances, contacts, and the objects themselves in 3D.

An **object** is one segmented thing measured as a whole, given as a folder: a source
image, one mask that bounds the object, and the label/mask volumes inside it. In this
project an object is a cell and its bounding mask is the plasma membrane, so `--object-mask pm`.
Nothing about the tool assumes that: the mask is named explicitly, never guessed, and
may be left out entirely - then the entities are measured where they lie.

Objects can be volumes or planes. A 2D object is measured as a plane, so area, perimeter,
circularity and one polarity angle; a 3D one as a volume, so volume, surface area,
sphericity, azimuth and elevation. Nothing is measured with the wrong formula and no plane
is padded into a volume one voxel deep; see the package README's
[2D and 3D](packages/anatomy/README.md#2d-and-3d) for the full column split.

It measures with its own loader and four processors, and ships seven viewer widgets as a
PixelPatrol viewer extension, all in [`packages/anatomy`](packages/anatomy). That package's
[README](packages/anatomy/README.md) is the reference for the data model, the widgets
and every configuration knob; this page is the short path through a run.

## Workflow

1. Organise your TIFFs in one of the input layouts below.
2. `pixel-patrol-anatomy dry-run` to check what will be analysed, and what was ignored.
3. `pixel-patrol-anatomy process` to write `report.parquet` (and, with `--with-mesh`, the geometry).
4. `pixel-patrol-anatomy view` to explore it, or hand the parquet to anyone with the hosted viewer.
   `pixel-patrol-anatomy colours report.parquet palette.json` sets a colour per structure at any point.
5. Optionally import an object's geometry into Blender.

## Try it

One command, no clone and no node:

```bash
uv pip install "pixel-patrol-anatomy @ git+https://github.com/betaseg/cellsketch-v2.git@main#subdirectory=packages/anatomy"
```

```bash
pixel-patrol-anatomy dry-run experiment/
pixel-patrol-anatomy process experiment/ -o report.parquet --object-mask pm \
    -p control -p treated --with-mesh
```

Then look at it. For everything except the 3D widgets, open
**<https://betaseg.github.io/cellsketch-v2/pixelpatrol-anatomy.html>** and choose
`report.parquet`: that page is the PixelPatrol viewer with this package's seven widgets built
in, and it reads the file in the browser, so nothing is uploaded and no server runs.

**The 3D widgets need a local viewer.** Geometry never enters the report - it is a separate
`geometry.parquet` per object, beside it - so a page in a browser cannot reach it, and those
two widgets stay empty. Fetch a prebuilt viewer once and serve the report yourself:

```bash
pixel-patrol-anatomy fetch-viewer            # ~11 MB, cached under ~/.cache
pixel-patrol-anatomy view report.parquet
```

That is still no node and no pixel-patrol checkout. The local server reads the geometry off
disk, which is the whole reason the 3D widgets work there and not in a hosted page.

`pixel-patrol-base` comes from git, pinned to a commit in this package's own dependencies,
so the one command brings it along. Folder discovery for suffix-less directories is in no
release yet.

## Install for development

The same install, editable, from a checkout:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e packages/anatomy
```

Every command below assumes that activated environment; without it, reach into the venv
directly instead (`.venv/bin/pixel-patrol-anatomy …`).

### Running the viewer locally

`pixel-patrol view` serves the viewer itself, and the viewer is a JavaScript bundle that
pixel-patrol builds rather than ships, so a plain install has none. `fetch-viewer` above is
the way to get one without node; build it from source only if you are changing the viewer
itself. Either way it is a one-off, not a step you repeat:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ida-mdc/pixel-patrol.git
git -C pixel-patrol checkout "$(grep -oE '[0-9a-f]{40}' packages/anatomy/pyproject.toml)"
(cd pixel-patrol/viewer && npm ci && npm run build)
uv pip install -e pixel-patrol/packages/pixel-patrol-base
```

Editing this package's own widgets needs none of that: the viewer serves them from the
source tree on every request, so a browser refresh is enough.

```bash
pixel-patrol-anatomy view report.parquet --significance
```

`-p` names the subdirectories to import as groups; that grouping becomes the default
comparison in every widget. `--with-mesh` is opt-in because meshing (and skeletonising
again for the overlay) is the most expensive part of a run.

Useful flags, see `pixel-patrol-anatomy process --help` for the rest:

- `--voxel-size-um z,y,x`: manual voxel size, otherwise inferred from the source TIFF
- `--object-mask NAME`: the mask that bounds each object, e.g. `pm`. Everything is measured
  relative to it, so it is never inferred; `dry-run` lists the masks each folder has. Leave
  it out and nothing bounds the object: no clipping, no cropping, and the columns that need
  a boundary (polarity, the object's own extent) are simply not written
- `--no-clip`: measure outside the object mask too. Entities are clipped to it by
  default, because that is what naming a bounding mask means: a field of view often
  holds neighbouring cells, and on one real alpha cell 3678 of 8800 granules lay
  entirely outside the plasma membrane. Pass this for data already confined to the
  object, or when truncating what straddles the boundary is worse than including it
- `--colours palette.json`: a colour per structure, e.g. `{"mito": "#d62728"}`. It lands in
  the report, so every widget draws that structure the same and a shared report arrives
  coloured; unnamed structures keep the built-in palette. `pixel-patrol-anatomy colours
  report.parquet palette.json` does it to a report you already have, in about a second
- `--skeleton-entities mito,er`: only skeletonise the structures where branches, length
  and tortuosity mean something; the single biggest saving on a long run
- `--no-instances` / `--no-contacts`: skip the expensive per-instance work
- `--contact-max-um T`: largest surface-to-surface gap recorded as a contact
- `--mesh-smooth-sigma` / `--mesh-step-size` / `--mesh-target-reduction` / `--mesh-level`
- `--mesh-workers N`: processes meshing one object's instances. The default divides the
  machine between the two levels of parallelism, so objects and instances do not each
  claim every core
- `--reuse-geometry`: keep the `geometry.parquet` an object already has rather than meshing
  it again. Meshing is most of a long run, so this is how a batch that died partway is
  finished in minutes. A file that is missing, empty or truncated is written again
- `--resume`: skip objects an interrupted run already measured. Each object's rows go to
  `<output>_parts/` the moment it finishes and are removed once the report is written, so
  a run that dies late no longer costs the objects it had already done

## Checking your input first (`dry-run`)

Before a long batch, check that every object has the files you expect:

```bash
pixel-patrol-anatomy dry-run experiment/
```

It reads TIFF headers only, so no analysis, no output, seconds even for a large batch. It
prints, per object: the source image with its size, the label and mask entities found
(`*` marks the object mask), and anything that looks wrong. Then a cross-object summary
of which entities are **missing in which objects**, and a suggested `--max-workers` for the
run. Exit code is `1` if any object cannot be analysed.

```text
control/cell_b
  source  sample_b.tif   [12.4 MB stacked]
  labels  mito
  masks   nucleus, pm*
  warn    ignored readme_overlay.tif: not <prefix>_<name>_label|labels|mask

===== 3 object folder(s) =====  (* = object mask)
  label:mito               2/3   ← missing in some objects
  mask:pm                  3/3
```

An uneven batch is worth catching here, and again in the viewer: the **Objects &
Structures** widget shows the same thing for the report you actually produced, and warns
when a structure is missing from some of them.

## Input data layout

Entity files must match `<prefix>_<name>_label.tif` (or `_labels.tif`) and
`<prefix>_<name>_mask.tif`, where `<prefix>` is the source image basename:

```text
my_cell/
  sample.tif
  sample_mito_label.tif
  sample_nucleus_mask.tif
  sample_membrane_mask.tif
```

One of the masks bounds the object, and `--object-mask NAME` says which. Always, with no
name-based guessing, because every distance and polarity in the report is measured against
it. Naming a mask a folder does not have is an error rather than a silent fallback, and the
message lists what that folder does have. An object folder can sit on its own, in a flat batch
(`cells/cell_a/`, `cells/cell_b/`), or in a grouped batch (`experiment/control/cell_a/`,
`experiment/treated/cell_b/`), where the group folder is what `-p` imports.

## Output

```text
report.parquet                            # one row per object, one per structure
report_meshes/<object>/geometry.parquet   # only with --with-mesh
```

Everything measured lands in `report.parquet`: per-structure rows (`obs_level = 1`) with
volume, surface area, sphericity and instance counts, and per-object rows (`obs_level = 0`)
carrying the per-instance, distance and contact tables as list columns the widgets unnest.
See the [package README](packages/anatomy/README.md#data-model) for the full model.

Geometry never enters the report, because meshes would multiply the size of a table every
query loads. It goes beside it, one `geometry.parquet` per object holding a mesh (or, for a
2D object, an outline) and a skeleton per instance, plus the contact edge list. The object
row records where, in `mesh_geometry_file`, which is how the 3D widgets find it.

## Blender

Use `geometry_to_blender.py` to import an object's `geometry.parquet` into Blender.

Requirements:

- Blender with `pandas` and `pyarrow` available in Blender's Python
  (`<blender>/python/bin/python3 -m pip install pandas pyarrow`)
- `geometry.parquet` generated by `pixel-patrol-anatomy process --with-mesh` or
  `pixel-patrol-anatomy mesh`, from **3D** objects. A 2D object carries outlines rather
  than meshes, which the viewer's gallery draws and Blender has no use for

Run headless:

```bash
blender --background --python geometry_to_blender.py -- /path/to/geometry.parquet [out.blend] [out_render.png]
```

Or run inside Blender Script Editor:

1. Open `geometry_to_blender.py`.
2. Set `GEOMETRY_PATH` (optionally `OUT_BLEND`, `OUT_RENDER`).
3. Run script (`Alt+P`).
